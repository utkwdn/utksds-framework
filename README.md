# University of Tennessee, Knoxville Design System Framework

The Official UT Digital Design System Framework was made to help UT web developers build interfaces that match UT's visual identity and make consistent the user interface of a variety of digital products.

## Requirements:

- npm [npm Docs: Installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Node.js 14 (using a [Node version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-node-js-and-npm) is highly recommended)
- Gulp 4.0.2 (will install as a dependency)

## Installing this project

1.  make sure you are running Node.js 14 prior to install
2.  run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Using Gulp Scripts

`gulp` watches the `/src/` directory for changes and creates files in `/build/`

If all that is needed is to build the files, you can run `gulp build`
